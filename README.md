# Self Introduction

***How long have you been in the Computer Science program?***
In 2016, I made a decision to pursue my degree at the age of 27. At that time, I enrolled in a local community college in hopes of achieving an Associateâ€™s degree in Engineering Technology. After taking a few classes, the program was cancelled due to lack of interest and I began brainstorming my options. It was in 2019, at 30 years old, when I decided that SHNU and Computer Science was to be my path. 

***What have you learned while in the program? List three of the most important concepts or skills you have learned.***
In the past 4-5 years, I have learned so much more than I ever could have envisioned while being enrolled in this program. The following are some of the concepts that have been extraordinarily beneficial to my own personal career.
* Database Systems: The knowledge of how to interact with large quantities of data in a quick and efficient manner.
* User Experience: One of my favorite concepts was understanding the science behind the user experience and interaction.
* Vision/Graphics: While this is a concept that I still need much more experience in, learning concepts surrounding computational graphics was among the most exciting and compelling things that I learned about.

***Discuss the specific skills you aim to demonstrate through your enhancements to reach each of the course outcomes.***
I plan on showcasing my ability to create beneficial user interfaces that enable the user to easily access the functionality of a given application. I plan on demonstrating the following,
* Adherence to best UI/UX practices
* Code readability and maintainability
* Interactivity to career specific databases
* Software design for procedural improvement in a career specific setting

***How do the specific skills you will demonstrate align with your career plans related to your degree?***
My goals from this program were to allow me to assist in improving procedures within my profession. The skills I aim to demonstrate will showcase examples of these tools that directly stem from the knowledge gained here at SNHU

***How does this contribute to the specialization you are targeting for your career?***
By showcasing tools created for the professional space, I will be demonstrating real-world examples of how my targeted specialization of creating career specific software is already seeing a benefit.
