# Enhancement One: Software Design/Engineering
For the software design and engineering element, I decided to choose a calculator application I wrote in Python back in 2020. This was the first real application I created, and one of my earliest creations in Python. The calculator provides process improvements in a laboratory environment and hosts relatively simply functionality in an easy to use interface. 
	My reasoning for choosing this element comes from the fact that I did not have the knowledge set I have now when I initially created this application. It was in desperate need of both a functionality overhaul, along with massive improvements in terms of how the code itself was written. One of the biggest elements that I changed within this application that show off my current skillset is the complete rewriting of the application’s code. During the enhancement, I was able to do the following,
*	Adjust variable/function names to adhere to a standard practice
*	Add in commenting and documentation
*	Reduce/eliminate redundant code blocks with better use of function calls

By doing this, the code is much more clean and readable, and more effective in the process. 
Another aspect that I enhanced shows off my ability to adhere to best practices in UI/UX principles by greatly improving the user interface of this application. I was able to consolidate the entire application within a single window, cleaning up the interface significantly. I also performed a complete overhaul of the “theme” selection within the utility, making it not only more user friendly when choosing the customizable layout, but much easier to add in new themes on a programming end. 
By performing this enhancement, I was able to meet the objectives I had previously planned. These surrounded demonstrating the execution of properly written code that is readable, maintainable, and functional, along with fully displaying my knowledge on creating a fully functional user interface that adheres to best practices. I was able to demonstrate that I am meeting the following course outcomes,

* Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices
* Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals
  
While working through the enhancement process, I was met with challenges throughout the process (as to be expected with any project). The first real challenge was dealing with the original code. As I mentioned, this was written exclusively by myself quite a few years ago. This was before I had any real experience in programming. Due to this, I found it difficult to recall what exactly was going on within this code, especially given the lack of commenting and poor readability within the code. I had to instead use the original application’s functionality as a basis/starting point, and re-write the code entirely from the ground up. This added time, but made the enhancement much easier in the end. 
I also ran into some minor trouble with the execution of the theme selection within the utility. In the previous code, I was calling multiple configuration function calls throughout when users would select a new color scheme via a button press. This was messy, both in the interface, and in the code. I wanted instead to feature a theme dropdown on the main menu, and store specific widget colors as variables. At first, I found difficulty in passing these color variables throughout all of the various screens. I was able to overcome this by declaring them globally within the theme function definition. Although I found this a bit more challenging than simply calling colors via button clicks, it was more rewarding when it became functional. It also looks significantly better within the application. 
Attached, you will find a quick video that details the enhanced utility in operation.
