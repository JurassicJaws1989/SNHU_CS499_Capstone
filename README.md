# Enhancement One: Software Design/Engineering
For the software design and engineering element, I decided to choose a calculator application I wrote in Python back in 2020. This was the first real application I created, and one of my earliest creations in Python. The calculator provides process improvements in a laboratory environment and hosts relatively simply functionality in an easy to use interface. 
	My reasoning for choosing this element comes from the fact that I did not have the knowledge set I have now when I initially created this application. It was in desperate need of both a functionality overhaul, along with massive improvements in terms of how the code itself was written. One of the biggest elements that I changed within this application that show off my current skillset is the complete rewriting of the application’s code. During the enhancement, I was able to do the following,
*	Adjust variable/function names to adhere to a standard practice
*	Add in commenting and documentation
*	Reduce/eliminate redundant code blocks with better use of function calls

By doing this, the code is much more clean and readable, and more effective in the process. 
Another aspect that I enhanced shows off my ability to adhere to best practices in UI/UX principles by greatly improving the user interface of this application. I was able to consolidate the entire application within a single window, cleaning up the interface significantly. I also performed a complete overhaul of the “theme” selection within the utility, making it not only more user friendly when choosing the customizable layout, but much easier to add in new themes on a programming end. 
By performing this enhancement, I was able to meet the objectives I had previously planned. These surrounded demonstrating the execution of properly written code that is readable, maintainable, and functional, along with fully displaying my knowledge on creating a fully functional user interface that adheres to best practices. I was able to demonstrate that I am meeting the following course outcomes,

* Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices
* Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals
  
While working through the enhancement process, I was met with challenges throughout the process (as to be expected with any project). The first real challenge was dealing with the original code. As I mentioned, this was written exclusively by myself quite a few years ago. This was before I had any real experience in programming. Due to this, I found it difficult to recall what exactly was going on within this code, especially given the lack of commenting and poor readability within the code. I had to instead use the original application’s functionality as a basis/starting point, and re-write the code entirely from the ground up. This added time, but made the enhancement much easier in the end. 
I also ran into some minor trouble with the execution of the theme selection within the utility. In the previous code, I was calling multiple configuration function calls throughout when users would select a new color scheme via a button press. This was messy, both in the interface, and in the code. I wanted instead to feature a theme dropdown on the main menu, and store specific widget colors as variables. At first, I found difficulty in passing these color variables throughout all of the various screens. I was able to overcome this by declaring them globally within the theme function definition. Although I found this a bit more challenging than simply calling colors via button clicks, it was more rewarding when it became functional. It also looks significantly better within the application. 
Attached, you will find some screenshots that detail the enhanced utility in operation.
